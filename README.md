# YPM Dark Data Internship

**Goal:** The main purpose of this internship was to explore the possible implications of Artificial Intelligence (OCR, image-classification, etc.) in the Museum/Gallery world.
* Over the course of 8 weeks, I investigated Optical Character Recogition, Multi-Modal AI, and Image-Classification with respect to their possible uses in the Yale Peabody Museum.
