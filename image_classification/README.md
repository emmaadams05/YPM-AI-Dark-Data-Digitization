# YPM Image Classification with Google's Teachable Machine

**Project Goal:** Use a machine learning model to classify images of the Yale Peabody Museum into various categories based on exhibit, date, etc. 

## System & Project Requirements
* Python
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Project Set Up
1. Set up coding environment and install required packages.
2. Create an image project on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) (saving the project to drive is **highly reccommended**.
3. Create labels and upload sample images to their respective labels.
4. Adjust the training settings and train the model
5. Export the model using the *Tensorflow* option and download the model.
6. Add the model to the same directory as a new python file.
7. Use Teachable Machine's provided code to assign labels to images.
